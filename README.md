Learning data structures from beginner to advanced levels is essential for becoming a proficient programmer and problem solver. Below is a **best-case roadmap** to guide you through mastering data structures effectively.

---

### **1. Beginner Level**
#### **1.1. Understand the Basics**

  - A way to organize and store data for efficient access and modification.
- **Why Learn Data Structures?**
  - To write efficient and scalable code.
  - To solve complex problems effectively.
- **Types of Data Structures:**
  - Primitive (e.g., integers, floats, characters).
  - Non-primitive (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues).

#### **1.2. Learn Basic Data Structures**
- **Arrays**
  - Fixed-size, contiguous memory.
  - Operations: Access, Insertion, Deletion, Traversal.
- **Strings**
  - Array of characters.
  - Operations: Concatenation, Substring, Searching.
- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List.
  - Doubly Linked List.
  - Circular Linked List.
- **Stacks**
  - LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
  - Operations: Push, Pop, Peek.
- **Queues**
  - FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
  - Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue.
  - Variations: Circular Queue, Priority Queue.

#### **1.3. Practice Problems**
- Reverse an array or string.
- Implement a stack or queue using arrays/linked lists.
- Check for balanced parentheses using a stack.
- Find the middle element of a linked list.
